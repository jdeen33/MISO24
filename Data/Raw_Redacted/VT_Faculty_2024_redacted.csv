I have been using Google Colab for this because it allows students to work with data files stored in a shared Google Drive folder and can be run from the browser.  This keeps me from having to do any troubleshooting of installations on individual computers, and it lets me de-bug students work from anywhere because I have access to their files in the shared drive.  I have been sharing templates with students to get them up to speed.  A couple years ago, I had inquired about a Jupyter Hub, but it sounded like it was never going to happen.  I since got set up with Google Colab and have had a good experience with it.  However, there are certain interactive visualizations that it cannot do, so it might be nice to be able to customize things in a Jupyter Hub.  For our department, we would absolutely need to be able to have students be able to upload files and keep them in their own folder that persists throughout the term.  If Google were ever to pull their support of Google Colab (which they have been known to do with some of their services), then our courses would suffer greatly."
